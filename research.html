                <i> Abstract. </i> The ready-made garment (RMG) industries in Bangladesh have become very competitive to cope with the competitors. The performance of this sector has attracted many countries to invest their money safely here and also earns foreign currency by exporting different materials like jute yarn. Jute yarn is a spun material which is prepared to use for weaving, knitting, sewing threads, carpets, carrying bags etc. In fiscal year 2015-16, according to data from Bangladesh’s Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), Bangladesh has earned $559 million by exporting jute yarn and twine. To meet the growing demand of jute yarn worldwide, Bangladesh still has lots of possibilities to earn huge amount of foreign currency by improving the quality. It’sa persistent need for Bangladeshi local jute yarn manufacturers to come forward, seek possibilities for improving quality, and fulfill the worldwide demand. The paper focuses on the application of AHP based QFD approach on a manufacturing company to improve its quality of product & improving the level of customer satisfaction. The paper shows how customer requirements can be identified and used them to prioritize the design requirements for improving quality of jute yarn. Here, AHP is integrated into house of quality (HOQ) that can be guide for overcoming the pitfalls of traditional QFD.<br><br>

                    <i> Abstract. </i> The ready-made garment industry is one of the most successful industries in Bangladesh. Its performance is notable over two decades. The purpose of this paper is to present a fuzzy quality function deployment (FQFD) model to identify customer requirements and design the production process and improve the quality of the T-shirts according to the requirements. To overcome the shortcomings of the traditional QFD, fuzzy set theory is integrated with HOQ. It will capture the vagueness of the customer requirements and facilitate to prioritise QFD information. For building HOQ, the design process starts with the data collection and ends with making some suggestions for improvement. Factors which improve the quality of the T-shirts have been identified from the HOQ matrices to develop some suggestions for improvements. The proposed improvements include: development of standard production operation of T-shirts, training workers, implementation of quality management department and development of flexible production schedule.<br><br>

                <i> Abstract. </i> In the winter of 2016, Boston Public Schools (BPS) launched a crowdsourcing national competition to create a better way to construct bus routes to improve efficiency, deepen the ability to model policy changes, and realign school start times. The winning team came from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). They developed an algorithm to construct school bus routes, by assigning students to stops, combining stops into routes, and optimally assigning vehicles to routes. BPS has used this algorithm for two years running; in the summer of 2017, this led to a 7% reduction in the BPS bus fleet. Bus routing optimization also gives BPS the unprecedented ability to understand the financial impact of new policies that affect transportation. In particular, the MIT research team developed a new mathematical model to select start times for all schools in the district in a way that takes transportation into account. Using this methodology, BPS proposed a solution that would have saved an additional $12M annually, and shifted students to more developmentally appropriate school start times (by reducing the number of high school students starting before 8:00 a.m. from 74% to 6% and the average number of elementary school students dismissed after 4:00 pm from 33% to 15%). However, 85% of the schools’ start times would have been changed, with a median change of one hour. This magnitude of change was too dramatic for the district to absorb, as evidenced by strong vocal opposition from some of the school communities who were negatively affected, and the plan was not implemented.<br><br>

                <i> Summary. </i> Spreading start times allows school districts to reduce transportation costs by reusing buses between schools. However, assigning each school a time involves both estimating the impact on transportation costs and reconciling additional competing objectives. These challenges force many school districts to make myopic decisions, leading to an expensive and inequitable status quo. For instance, most American teenagers start school before 8:00 AM, despite evidence of significant associated health issues. We propose an algorithm to jointly solve the school bus routing and bell time selection problems. Our application in Boston led to $5 million in yearly savings (maintaining service quality despite a 50-bus fleet reduction) and to the unanimous approval of the first school start time reform in 30 years.<br><br>

                    <i> Summary. </i> Understanding complex city traffic patterns is a major priority for modern urban planners, leading to a sharp increase in the amount and the diversity of traffic data being collected. For instance, taxi companies in many major cities now record metadata for every individual car ride, such as its origin, destination, and travel time. In this paper, we show that we can leverage network optimization insights to extract accurate travel time estimations from such origin–destination data, using information from a large number of taxi trips to reconstruct the traffic patterns in an entire city. Using synthetic data, we establish the robustness of our algorithm to high variance data, and the interpretability of its results. We then use hundreds of thousands of taxi travel time observations in Manhattan to show that our algorithm can provide insights about urban traffic patterns on different scales and accurate travel time estimations throughout the network. <br><br>

                <i> Abstract. </i> Getting students to the right school at the right time can pose a challenge for school districts in the United States, which must balance educational objectives with operational ones, often on a shoestring budget. Examples of such operational challenges include deciding which students should attend, how they should travel to school, and what time classes should start. From an optimizer’s perspective, these decision problems are difficult to solve in isolation, and present a formidable challenge to solve together. In this paper, we develop an optimization-based approach to three key problems in school operations: school assignment, school bus routing, and school start time selection. Our methodology is comprehensive, flexible enough to accommodate a variety of problem specifics, and relies on a tractable decomposition approach. In particular, it comprises a new algorithm for jointly scheduling school buses and selecting school start times, that leverages the simplifying assumption of fixed route arrival times to allow for multiple objectives and enhance tractability. We show that our methodology can significantly streamline the operations of Boston Public Schools Extended School Year (ESY) summer program for special education students. Using summer 2019 data, we find that replacing the actual student-to-school assignment with our method could lead to total cost savings of up to 8%. Our models can also be used to quantify the costs and benefits of particular operational policies, providing administrators with an analytics framework to evaluate potential decisions.<br><br>

                <i> Summary. </i> Missing information is inevitable in real-world data sets. While imputation is well-suited and theoretically sound for statistical inference, its relevance and practical implementation for out-of-sample prediction remains unsettled. We provide a theoretical analysis of widely used data imputation methods, including mode and mean imputation, and highlight their key deficiencies in making accurate predictions. Alternatively, we propose adaptive linear regression, a new class of models that can be directly trained and evaluated on partially observed data, adapting to the set of available features. <br><br>

                <i> Abstract. </i> When quantitative models are used to support decision-making on complex and important topics, understanding a model's "reasoning" can increase trust in its predictions, expose hidden biases, or reduce vulnerability to adversarial attacks. However, the concept of interpretability remains loosely defined and application-specific. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework in which machine learning models are constructed in a sequence of interpretable steps. We show that for a variety of models, a natural choice of interpretable steps recovers standard interpretability proxies (e.g., sparsity in linear models). We then generalize these proxies to yield a parametrized family of consistent measures of model interpretability. This formal definition allows us to quantify the "price" of interpretability, i.e., the tradeoff with predictive accuracy. We demonstrate practical algorithms to apply our framework on real and synthetic datasets.<br><br>
